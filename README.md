# Your task

ArmorHQ has a customer named Dana. She's the head of sales at a 200-person inside sales team and she pays us a lot of money. The last time her account manager talked to her, she said:

> "I don't need another spreadsheet. I just want to know — week to week — whether my agents are getting better or worse, and who I should be talking to on Monday morning. Right now I'm guessing."

Build her that dashboard at `/`.

The data is already in your local database. Two tables, `agents` and `calls`. Around 3,000 calls across 12 agents over the last three weeks. Schema in `schema.sql`. Everything you query has to go through `src/lib/db.ts`.

What goes on the dashboard is up to you. We hire people who can decide.

## Two non-negotiables

1. **The number Dana checks every Monday.** She asks her operations lead "how many calls did we connect last week?" That number — calls whose `outcome` is `connected` and whose `started_at` falls within the rolling 7 days from right now — must appear clearly somewhere on the dashboard, and must come from a live query against the database. If it's wrong or hardcoded, the rest doesn't matter.

2. **Ship the reporting API.** Dana's account manager and the customer success team need machine-readable access to the same data the dashboard shows, in four shapes. All four endpoints are live-queried, return JSON unless noted, and follow the error format below.

   **`/api/weekly-digest`** — last 28 days of overall activity. Returns:
   - `data`: 28 entries, oldest first. Each: `date` (YYYY-MM-DD), `connected_count` (int), `total_count` (int), `by_team` (object mapping team name to connected calls that day).
   - `top_agents`: 3 entries — the three agents with the most connected calls in the last 7 days. Each: `name`, `team`, `connected_count`.
   - `meta`: `{ "generated_at": ISO 8601 string, "window_start": YYYY-MM-DD, "window_end": YYYY-MM-DD }`.

   **`/api/weekly-digest.csv`** — same daily data as a CSV file the customer success team drops into Google Sheets. Columns: `date`, `connected_count`, `total_count`, `top_team`, `top_team_connects`. Header row required. `Content-Type: text/csv`. Team names can contain spaces — escape correctly.

   **`/api/agents/[id]/scorecard`** — one agent's last 14 days. Returns:
   - `agent`: `{ "id", "name", "team", "hire_date" }`.
   - `last_14_days`: 14 entries, oldest first. Each: `date`, `connected_count`, `total_count`.
   - `totals`: `{ "connected_last_7", "connected_prior_7", "connect_rate_last_7" }` (rate is 0–1).
   - `meta`: same shape as above.
   - 404 if the id doesn't match an agent. Error body: `{ "error": "agent_not_found", "id": "<the id>" }`.

   **`/api/teams/[name]/summary`** — one team's roll-up for the last 7 days. Team names in the URL come URL-encoded (e.g. `West%20Coast`). Returns:
   - `team`: `{ "name", "agent_count" }`.
   - `last_7_days`: `{ "connected_count", "total_count", "connect_rate" }`.
   - `agents`: array of `{ "id", "name", "connected_count", "total_count" }`, sorted descending by `connected_count`.
   - `meta`: same shape.
   - 404 if the team has no agents. Error body: `{ "error": "team_not_found", "name": "<the name>" }`.

   **All four endpoints set `Cache-Control: no-store`** (numbers are always live).
   **All error responses set the appropriate HTTP status code** (404 for the not-found cases above; 400 for malformed input if you encounter any).
   **Don't repeat yourself** — the data layer is one module; the four routes are thin.

## Constraints

- Use this Next.js project. Don't start a new one.
- Use the supplied UI components in `src/components/ui/`. If you need more, add them from the same library, which is called shadcn. Don't bring in a different one.
- All data has to come through `src/lib/db.ts`. No queries anywhere else, no numbers pasted into the page or the API.
- Don't add new top-level dependencies unless you really need to.
- pnpm only.
- Node 22.5 or newer (the local database uses Node's built-in `node:sqlite`). `.nvmrc` is provided.
- The page has to look reasonable on a phone — Dana's at the airport a lot, so 375px wide must work. ArmorHQ logo is at `public/logo.png`. Put it in the header.

## The afterlife

After this ships to Dana, our QA team needs to verify the numbers monthly without asking you. **Ship at least one automated test for the metric calculations.** Vitest is set up — `pnpm test` will run it. Pick what's worth testing.

And in three months when an intern takes this over, they'll need to know what you decided and why. Comments where it matters.
